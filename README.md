# To do list web page

This little project was for day 3 and 4 of the #100daysofWeb through Talk Python and Pybites

I decided to make a to do list site as I thought it would be useful and test my skills.

You can add and delete tasks from each day and the tasks persist in local storage.

Make a virtual environment by typing ```python3.9 -m venv venv``` hit enter, 

then if you are on mac, type: ```source venv/bin/activate```<br> if you are on windows type: 
```.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat```

Next, install the requirements by typing ```pip install  -r requirements.txt```

You can run the page by typing ```flask run``` in your terminal
